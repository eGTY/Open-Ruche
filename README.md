# Open-Ruche
Bee hive equipped with an interior and exterior temperature sensor, a weight sensor, an anemometer and a weathercock. All powered by solar energy and accessible from any device connected to the Internet.

This project has been realised by a team of four apprentice engineers at the school of Polytech Sorbonne thanks to mister Yann DOUZE (yann.douze@sorbonne-universite.fr) and mister Sylvain VIATEUR (sylvain.viateur@sorbonne-universite.fr).

This project is composed of four files and one folder : 
- A bill of specifications.
- A bill of material.
- A description of the deployment.
- A general drawing.
- A folder with our codes.

I hope everything is as clear as possible. Good luck !
